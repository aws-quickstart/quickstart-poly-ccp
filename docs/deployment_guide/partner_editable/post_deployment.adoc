=== Additional steps for deployment option 2

* The status for the second deployment option will reach CREATE_IN_PROGRESS but will pause at CertificateForCDN creation. The deployment requires an extra, manual step to reach CREATE_COMPLETE.

1. On the console, choose *Certificate Manager*, and locate the new certificate with the domain name you have specified. The Validation state will be *Pending validation*.

2. Expand the drop-down menu to the left of the domain and choose *Create record on Route 53*. A success message appears.

After a few minutes, the certificate will show the status *Issued*.

At this point the stack creation will automatically resume. On the CloudFront console, you should see a new CloudFront distribution.

=== Completing the deployment

1. On the AWS CloudFormation console, when the status is *CREATE_COMPLETE*, the Poly-integrated Amazon Connect CCP cluster is ready.
2. Use the URLs displayed in the *Outputs tab* for the stack to view the resources that were created.
3. Copy the *WebSiteURL* value that is displayed on the *Outputs* tab.

4. On the Amazon Connect console, choose your Amazon Connect instance, choose *Application Integration*, and then choose *Add origin*.
5. Paste the website URL that you copied earlier, and then choose *Add*.

=== Test the deployment

1. In Chrome or Firefox, visit the link that is displayed on the Outputs tab, e.g., https://myamazonconnect.mydomain.com. The first time you do so, you might need to enable popups in the browser so that the Amazon Connect CCP login box can be displayed.

Once you have enabled pop-ups, the login will popup in a second tab.

1. Enter your Amazon Connect user credentials. To find your credentials, log in to your Amazon Connect instance as *Administrator*, choose *Users*, and then choose *User Management*.
