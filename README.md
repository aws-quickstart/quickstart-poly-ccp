## Poly-Integrated Amazon Connect CCP on AWS

This Quick Start automatically deploys the Poly-integrated Amazon Connect Contact Control Panel (CCP) in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud in about 30 minutes. This Quick Start is for users who have already configured an Amazon Connect instance in their AWS account and want to enable support for Poly, which provides headset button call control.

The Quick Start deploys a small website into your AWS account, consisting of a Poly-integrated version of the Amazon Connect CCP. The website integrates Poly with Amazon Connect CCP by combining the Amazon Connect Streams application programming interface (API) and the Plantronics Hub API

This Quick Start deployment includes an option for deploying with an existing domain name. When using this option, the Quick Start must be deployed in the US East (N. Virginia) Region.

You can use the AWS CloudFormation template included with the Quick Start to deploy the Poly-integrated Amazon Connect CCP in your AWS account in about 30 minutes.
